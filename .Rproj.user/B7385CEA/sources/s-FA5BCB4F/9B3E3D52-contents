# Introduction {#intro}

The _twinetverse_ includes three packages:

* [_rtweet_](http://rtweet.info/)
* [_graphTweets_](http://graphtweets.john-coene.com/)
* [_sigmajs_](http://sigmajs.john-coene.com/)

Within the context of visualising Twitter interactions, each of the packages listed above fill in a specific need and a distinct step of the process, 1) _collecting_ the data, 2) _building_ the graphs and finally 3) _visualising_ the graphs.

In the following [section](pkgs) we look at each individual package and what they bring to the _twinetverse_.

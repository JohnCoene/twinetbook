The twinetverse package is available on Github and Bitbucket. devtools::install_bitbucket(&quot;JohnCoene/twinetverse&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;JohnCoene/twinetverse&quot;) The package is unlikely to make it onto CRAN, it may be considered once all of its children packages are on CRAN, but not until then.

["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction The twinetverse includes three packages: rtweet (Kearney 2018) graphTweets (Coene 2018a) sigmajs (Coene 2018b) Within the context of visualising Twitter interactions, each of the packages listed above fill in a specific need and a distinct step of the process, 1) collecting the data, 2) building the graphs and finally 3) visualising the graphs of said interactions. We eventually look at the packages that make up the twinetverse. References "],
["pkgs.html", "Chapter 3 Packages 3.1 rtweet 3.2 graphTweets 3.3 sigmajs", " Chapter 3 Packages Below are the packages that make up in the twinetverse as well as some explanation of what they bring to visualising Twitter interactions. 3.1 rtweet If we are going to visualise Twitter interactions we are going to need data, namely tweets. The rtweet package (Kearney 2018) wraps the Twitter API, thereby giving R users easy access to tweets. 3.1.1 Usage rtweet fills the very first step in visualising Twitter interactions, collecting the necessary data. Note that the package lets you do much more than simply downloading tweets, however, this is its main function within the twinetverse. 3.2 graphTweets 3.2.1 Rationale The graphTweets package (Coene 2018a) lets you build lists of nodes and edges from tweets collected with rtweet. The package is faily straighforward and inludes but a few functions. However, it still enables you to build relatively complex graphs. The package revolves around two core functions which respectively allow you to build data.frames of edges and nodes. These edges and nodes (also referred to as vertices) together map Twitter conversations by linking the sender of a tweet to the user(s) he or she (???). 3.2.2 Usage All functions of the package start with gt_. graphTweets fills the second step in visualising Twitter interactions, building the graphs from the collected data. 3.3 sigmajs The sigmajs package (Coene 2018b) is a powerful library to visualise the networks we have built using graphTweets. The package, like graphTweets, is pipe-friendly (%&gt;%), therefore making it easy to go from building a graph to visualising it. It can also easily represent dynamic networks, something otherwise not evident in R. Features: Highly interactive Crosstalk integrated Includes Shiny proxies Events in Shiny Buttons to trigger interactions. and more. 3.3.1 Usage All functions of the package start with sg_. sigmajs is the final piece of the puzzle, visualising the graphs we have built.

["prerequisites.html", "Chapter 4 Prerequisites 4.1 Install 4.2 Setup rtweet", " Chapter 4 Prerequisites In this chapter we get you set up and running with the twinetverse, namely the package installation and setting up rtweet to fetch tweets. 4.1 Install The package can be install with devtools devtools (Wickham, Hester, and Chang 2018) or remotes (Csárdi et al. 2017), it is available from Github or Bitbucket: The twinetverse package can be installed from Github: devtools::install_github(&quot;JohnCoene/twinetverse&quot;) or from Bitbucket: devtools::install_bitbucket(&quot;JohnCoene/twinetverse&quot;) In the book we don’t explicitly load the package and assume you have it loaded in your environment: library(twinetverse) 4.2 Setup rtweet The rtweet package requires some set up. This is not only extremely easy but also very well explained on rtweet’s official website, so head over there if the short description below does not satisfy. In essence, you will need a Twitter “app” to access its API, to create one: Head over to apps.twitter.com and login or signup if you do not have a Twitter account. Click create an app. In the following form, enter an app name, whatever you want, this does not matter. Enter a description, then again, it doesn’t matter. Website, simply put a valid website, you can link to your Twitter profile if you do not have one, i.e.: https://twitter.com/jdatap Callback URL, this is important, in there put the following: http://127.0.0.1:1410. You’re now setup with an app, take note of the following under “Keys and Access Tokens”, as you will need it to create your token and fetch tweets: Consumer Key (API Key) Consumer Secret (API Secret) Access Token Access Token Secret Create your token with like so. library(twinetverse) TK &lt;- create_token( &quot;My Application Name&quot;, consumer_key = &quot;XxxxXxXXxXx&quot;, consumer_secret = &quot;XxxxXxXXxXx&quot;, access_token = &quot;XxxxXxXXxXx&quot;, access_secret = &quot;XxxxXxXXxXx&quot; ) Ideally, also save it. There is no need to re-create a token everytime you want to download data. Once saved you can easily load it readRDS (we’ll demonstrate that in the next chapter). saveRDS(TK, file = &quot;token.rds&quot;) You’re all set to use the twinetverse! References "],
["get-started.html", "Chapter 5 Get Started 5.1 Collect 5.2 Build 5.3 Visualise 5.4 Recap", " Chapter 5 Get Started In this chapter we briefly explore the twinetverse: we collect tweets, build and visualise our first graph. A note if you follow this along in RStudio; the visualisations do not open in the viewer and instead open in your default browser. 5.1 Collect See the prerequisites section if the line below confuses you. TK &lt;- readRDS(&quot;token.rds&quot;) rtweet lets you do a lot of things, however within the context of the twinetverse we mainly use its search_tweets to get tweets. tweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;rstats&quot;, token = TK) ## Searching for tweets... ## Finished collecting tweets! The search_tweets function takes a few arguments which we’ll eventually get into, above we run the simplest possible call; fetching tweets about “rstats”, a reference to the R (R Core Team 2017) Twitter #hashtag, by default the function returns 100 tweets. Note that we also pass our token to the function. Each row a is a tweet, rtweet returns quite a lot of variables (87), we’ll only look at a select few. names(tweets) ## [1] &quot;user_id&quot; &quot;status_id&quot; ## [3] &quot;created_at&quot; &quot;screen_name&quot; ## [5] &quot;text&quot; &quot;source&quot; ## [7] &quot;display_text_width&quot; &quot;reply_to_status_id&quot; ## [9] &quot;reply_to_user_id&quot; &quot;reply_to_screen_name&quot; ## [11] &quot;is_quote&quot; &quot;is_retweet&quot; ## [13] &quot;favorite_count&quot; &quot;retweet_count&quot; ## [15] &quot;hashtags&quot; &quot;symbols&quot; ## [17] &quot;urls_url&quot; &quot;urls_t.co&quot; ## [19] &quot;urls_expanded_url&quot; &quot;media_url&quot; ## [21] &quot;media_t.co&quot; &quot;media_expanded_url&quot; ## [23] &quot;media_type&quot; &quot;ext_media_url&quot; ## [25] &quot;ext_media_t.co&quot; &quot;ext_media_expanded_url&quot; ## [27] &quot;ext_media_type&quot; &quot;mentions_user_id&quot; ## [29] &quot;mentions_screen_name&quot; &quot;lang&quot; ## [31] &quot;quoted_status_id&quot; &quot;quoted_text&quot; ## [33] &quot;quoted_created_at&quot; &quot;quoted_source&quot; ## [35] &quot;quoted_favorite_count&quot; &quot;quoted_retweet_count&quot; ## [37] &quot;quoted_user_id&quot; &quot;quoted_screen_name&quot; ## [39] &quot;quoted_name&quot; &quot;quoted_followers_count&quot; ## [41] &quot;quoted_friends_count&quot; &quot;quoted_statuses_count&quot; ## [43] &quot;quoted_location&quot; &quot;quoted_description&quot; ## [45] &quot;quoted_verified&quot; &quot;retweet_status_id&quot; ## [47] &quot;retweet_text&quot; &quot;retweet_created_at&quot; ## [49] &quot;retweet_source&quot; &quot;retweet_favorite_count&quot; ## [51] &quot;retweet_retweet_count&quot; &quot;retweet_user_id&quot; ## [53] &quot;retweet_screen_name&quot; &quot;retweet_name&quot; ## [55] &quot;retweet_followers_count&quot; &quot;retweet_friends_count&quot; ## [57] &quot;retweet_statuses_count&quot; &quot;retweet_location&quot; ## [59] &quot;retweet_description&quot; &quot;retweet_verified&quot; ## [61] &quot;place_url&quot; &quot;place_name&quot; ## [63] &quot;place_full_name&quot; &quot;place_type&quot; ## [65] &quot;country&quot; &quot;country_code&quot; ## [67] &quot;geo_coords&quot; &quot;coords_coords&quot; ## [69] &quot;bbox_coords&quot; &quot;name&quot; ## [71] &quot;location&quot; &quot;description&quot; ## [73] &quot;url&quot; &quot;protected&quot; ## [75] &quot;followers_count&quot; &quot;friends_count&quot; ## [77] &quot;listed_count&quot; &quot;statuses_count&quot; ## [79] &quot;favourites_count&quot; &quot;account_created_at&quot; ## [81] &quot;verified&quot; &quot;profile_url&quot; ## [83] &quot;profile_expanded_url&quot; &quot;account_lang&quot; ## [85] &quot;profile_banner_url&quot; &quot;profile_background_url&quot; ## [87] &quot;profile_image_url&quot; 5.2 Build Now we can use the second package part of the twinetverse, graphTweets. Again, we’ll leave all function’s arguments to default to get a simple graph. There’s a lot more to the package which we’ll explore in later chapters. net &lt;- tweets %&gt;% gt_edges(text, screen_name, status_id) We called gt_edges on our tweets data.frame, passing a few bare column names. The source of the tweets will also be the source of our edges so we pass screen_name, then the target of these edges will be users tagged in the tweets, text variable in rtweet. The object returned is of an unfamiliar class. class(net) ## [1] &quot;graphTweets&quot; To extracts the results from graphTweets run gt_collect, this will work at any point in the chain of pipes (%&gt;%). net &lt;- net %&gt;% gt_collect() class(net) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; Great but this returns a lists and R users much prefer data.frames. graphTweets actualy returns two data.frames that encapsulated in a list. Indeed networks cannot be compressed into a single data.frame, we have 1) nodes and 2) edges. names(net) ## [1] &quot;edges&quot; &quot;nodes&quot; Great, so it looks like we have both nodes and edges, not really. We only have edges, net$nodes is actually NULL. lapply(net, class) ## $edges ## [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; ## ## $nodes ## [1] &quot;NULL&quot; Well, we only ran gt_edges so it make sense that we only have edges. Let’s scrap that and get both nodes and edges. net &lt;- tweets %&gt;% gt_edges(text, screen_name, status_id) %&gt;% # get edges gt_nodes() %&gt;% # get nodes gt_collect() # collect lapply(net, class) ## $edges ## [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; ## ## $nodes ## [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; Before we move on, something to note. graphTweets requires that you run the functions in the correct order, first gt_edges and second gt_nodes. This is because one can only know the nodes of a graph based on the edges and not vice versa. Now we’re good, we have downloaded tweets and have everything we need to visualise it; nodes and edges. 5.3 Visualise We can visualise the network with sigmajs. Then again, it’s very easy and follows the same idea as graphTweets; we pipe our nodes and edges through. Before we do so, for the sake of clarity, let’s unpack our network using the %&lt;-% from the Zeallot package (Teetor 2018), imported by the twinetverse. c(edges, nodes) %&lt;-% net Let’s take a look at the edges. head(edges) source target rstudio hadleywickham minebocek groundwalkergmb minebocek visnut KathyQ100lady dataandme KathyQ100lady stah groundwalkergmb visnut Edges simply consist of source and target, as explained earlier on, source essentially corresponds to screen_name passed in gt_edges, it is the user who posted the tweet. In contrast, target includes the users that were tagged in the text of the tweet. Now let’s take a look at the nodes: head(nodes) nodes type n_edges 1567lisa user 2 AbidjanRusers user 2 AI_PhD user 1 AlexielMedyna user 1 alice_data user 1 amparofashion user 3 In the nodes data frame the column n_edges is the number edges the node appears in, while the nodes column are the Twitter handles of both the authors of the tweets (screen_name) and those who were tagged in the tweets (text). Below we rename a few columns, to meet sigmajs’ naming convention. We add ids to our nodes, this can be a string and thus simply corresponds to our nodes column. We essentially rename n_edges to size as this is what sigmajs understands (more on this later). We add ids to our edges as sigmajs requires each edge to have a unique id. nodes$id &lt;- as.factor(nodes$nodes) nodes$size &lt;- nodes$n_edges edges$id &lt;- seq(1, nrow(edges)) sigmajs has a specific but sensible naming convention as well as basic minimal requirements. Nodes must at least include id, and size. Edges must at least include id, source, and target. Well actually, the twinetverse comes with helper functions to prepare the nodes and edges build from graphTweets for use in sigmajs (these are the only functions the ’verse provides). nodes &lt;- nodes2sg(nodes) edges &lt;- edges2sg(edges) Let’s visualise that, we must initialise every sigmajs graph with the sigmajs function, then we add our nodes with sg_nodes, passing the column names we mentioned previously, id, and size to meet sigmajs’ minimum requirements. At the exception of sigmajs, all functions of the sigmajs package start with sg_ sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size) sigmajs actually allows you to build graphs using only nodes or edges, we’ll see why this is useful in a later chapter on temporal graphs. Let’s add the edges. Then again, to meet sigmajs’ requirements, we pass id, source and target. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size) %&gt;% sg_edges(edges, id, source, target) This graph does not look great. We’ll beautify that bit by bit as we move through the book: sigmajs is highly customisable. Nevermind beauty, what’s on the graph exactly? Each disk/point on the graph is a twitter user, they are connected when one has tagged the other in the a tweet. You may also notice that the graph contains surprisingly few nodes, given that we queried 100 tweets you would expect over 100 nodes on the graph. This is because our visualisation only includes tweets that mention other users and most tweets are not targeted (tagged) at other users. There is an easy remedy to this which we’ll look at in the advanced chapter. 5.4 Recap This chapter aimed at demonstrating the basic principles behind the packages and the order in which to use the packages that form the twinetverse. The chapter may look long~ish but the code is not, here it is put together. library(dplyr) # COLLECT tweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;rstats&quot;, token = TK) # BUILD net &lt;- tweets %&gt;% gt_edges(text, screen_name, status_id) %&gt;% gt_nodes() %&gt;% gt_collect() c(edges, nodes) %&lt;-% net nodes &lt;- nodes2sg(nodes) edges &lt;- edges2sg(edges) # Visualise sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size) %&gt;% sg_edges(edges, id, source, target) Remember the workflow of the twinetverse: We collect the data We build the graph We visualise the network References "],
["advanced.html", "Chapter 6 Advanced 6.1 Collect 6.2 Build 6.3 Visualise", " Chapter 6 Advanced In this chapter we essentially replicate what we did in the Get Started chapter but in a somewhat more advanced manner as we introduce new functions and arguments. 6.1 Collect Let’s collect more tweets this time, we’ll also optimise our Twitter query. This is very useful as the Twitter API (like the vast majority of APIs) limits the amount of data you can access by imposing a rate limit. You can always check where you stand with the various Twitter rate limits with rate_limit(). We set include_rts = FALSE as we don’t need the same tweet multiple times, it does not add information to our graph (currently but it could). We also pass a slightly more sophisticated query to the search tweet endpoint. This is too often overlooked, the Twitter API provides advanced operators: you are not limited to searching a single keyword every time. We query 1,000 tweets that: Include #rstats Include a mention i.e.: \\@jdatap Are original (not re-tweets) Remember to load your token if you’re in a new environment. # TK &lt;- readRDS(file = &quot;token.rds&quot;) tweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;#rstats filter:mentions&quot;, n = 1000, token = TK, include_rts = FALSE) ## Searching for tweets... ## Finished collecting tweets! 6.2 Build Let’s build the graph, just like we did before. There is more to graphTweets but we won’t look into that just yet. net &lt;- tweets %&gt;% gt_edges(text, screen_name, status_id) %&gt;% gt_nodes() %&gt;% gt_collect() 6.3 Visualise Let’s make a slightly more interesting visualisation this time. First, we’ll prepare the data for sigmajs like we did in the get started chapter. c(edges, nodes) %&lt;-% net nodes &lt;- nodes2sg(nodes) edges &lt;- edges2sg(edges) Now onto the visualisation. We add labels that will display on hover. We color the nodes by cluster. We layout the graph appropriately using one of igraph’s (file. 2018) many layout algorithms. We use sigmajs’ settings to change the edges color. # Visualise sigmajs(&quot;webgl&quot;) %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, label, size) %&gt;% sg_edges(edges, id, source, target) %&gt;% sg_layout(layout = igraph::layout_components) %&gt;% sg_cluster( colors = c( &quot;#0084b4&quot;, &quot;#00aced&quot;, &quot;#1dcaff&quot;, &quot;#c0deed&quot; ) ) %&gt;% sg_settings( minNodeSize = 1, maxNodeSize = 2.5, edgeColor = &quot;default&quot;, defaultEdgeColor = &quot;#d3d3d3&quot; ) ## Found # 277 clusters Already looking better.

["hashtags.html", "Chapter 7 Hashtags", " Chapter 7 Hashtags The twinetverse, or graphTweets more specifically, not only enables visualising interactions between users, it also lets one build and visualise networks of users and the hashtag(s) they use. Let’s collect some tweets, since we want to plot relationships between users and hashtags we’ll specify two hashtags: #python and #rstats. This way we’ll be able to see who uses both or either. Moreover it shows another Twitter API search operator. # TK &lt;- readRDS(file = &quot;token.rds&quot;) tweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;#rstats OR #python&quot;, n = 1000, token = TK, include_rts = FALSE) ## Searching for tweets... ## Finished collecting tweets! Now let’s build a network of hashtags to visualise which user tweets which #hashtag. net &lt;- tweets %&gt;% gt_edges_hash(hashtags, screen_name) %&gt;% gt_nodes() %&gt;% gt_collect() Let’s inspect the edges first. head(net$edges) source target n_tweets runal #lisp 1 runal #python 1 _ColinFay #rstats 4 _grace_law #bokeh 1 _grace_law #jupyter 1 _grace_law #python 1 The edges include the n_tweets variable which is the number tweets the #hashtag is found in. Note that in order to ensure we can always distinguish between a user and a hashtag, hashtag are preceded by the the # signs. Let’s take a look at the nodes. head(net$nodes) nodes type n_edges #おすすめ hashtag 1 #ただのプーさん hashtag 1 #アプリ開発 hashtag 1 #エンジニア hashtag 1 #クジラ飛行机 hashtag 1 #スクレイピング hashtag 1 Nodes also include the type which is either set to user or hashtag. Only one function changes, we use gt_edges_hash instead of gt_edges. While the latter builds networks of users, as we should be somewhat familiar with already, the former build networks that map users to the hashtags they use in their tweets, it thus make sense to pass hashtags instead of text as rtweet neatly extracts that for us. Now onto the visualisation. As we did before, we unpack our network, then we prepare the data to fit sigmajs’ expectation, and we color the nodes according to the type, one colour for #hashtags and another for @users. c(edges, nodes) %&lt;-% net nodes &lt;- nodes2sg(nodes) edges &lt;- edges2sg(edges) nodes$color &lt;- ifelse(nodes$type == &quot;user&quot;, &quot;#0084b4&quot;, &quot;#1dcaff&quot;) In the visualisation we add sg_neighbours to highlight nodes and its neighbours on click. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size, color, label) %&gt;% sg_edges(edges, id, source, target) %&gt;% sg_layout(layout = igraph::layout_components) %&gt;% sg_settings( edgeColor = &quot;default&quot;, defaultEdgeColor = &quot;#d3d3d3&quot; ) %&gt;% sg_neighbours() It is interesting to see that few users actually tweet both hashtags, this wouldn’t have to be in the same tweet so it is somewhat surprising. "],
["ego.html", "Chapter 8 Ego", " Chapter 8 Ego In this chapter we briefly go over ego networks with the twinetverse. Ego networks are graphs of a focal node. To do so we collect tweets not by keyword but instead posted by a user, essentially downloading the user’s timeline. tl &lt;- rtweet::get_timeline(&quot;jdatap&quot;, n = 50) Then we build the network, like we did before, just adding the missing source column. net &lt;- tl %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(src = &quot;jdatap&quot;) %&gt;% gt_edges(text, src, status_id) %&gt;% gt_nodes() %&gt;% gt_collect() Then we unpack the network and count the edges. c(edges, nodes) %&lt;-% net edges &lt;- edges %&gt;% dplyr::count(source, target) %&gt;% edges2sg() nodes &lt;- nodes2sg(nodes) Then we plot the network. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, label, size) %&gt;% sg_edges(edges, source, target, id) %&gt;% sg_layout() %&gt;% sg_settings( defaultNodeColor = &quot;#1dcaff&quot;, edgeColor = &quot;default&quot;, defaultEdgeColor = &quot;#d3d3d3&quot;, labelThreshold = 1 ) As you can see all the nodes (users) are linked to a single node, which is the user whose timeline we downloaded.

["dynamic.html", "Chapter 9 Dynamic Edges 9.1 Rationale 9.2 Collect 9.3 Build 9.4 Visualise", " Chapter 9 Dynamic Edges So far we have been drawing static graphs, in this chapter we look at dynamic ones, namely temporal. However, being an introduction we’ll first only have dynamic edges: we’ll tackle the fully temporal network further down the book. 9.1 Rationale We’ve been visualising Twitter interactions in a static manner, but they are dynamic when you think of it. Twitter conversations happen over time, thus far, we’ve been drawing all encompassing snapshots. So let’s take into account the time factor to make a tempral graphs. 9.2 Collect We’ll collect some tweets again, but feel free to use previously collected tweets; nothing changes at this stage. # TK &lt;- readRDS(file = &quot;token.rds&quot;) tweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;#rstats filter:mentions&quot;, n = 5000, token = TK, include_rts = FALSE) ## Searching for tweets... ## Finished collecting tweets! 9.3 Build Now onto building the graph. net &lt;- tweets %&gt;% gt_edges(text, screen_name, status_id, created_at = &quot;created_at&quot;) %&gt;% gt_nodes() %&gt;% gt_dyn() %&gt;% gt_collect() Quite a few things differ from previous graphs we have built. We pass created_at in gt_edges. This in effect adds the created_at column to our edges, so that we know the created time of post in which the edge appears. We use gt_dyn which stands for dynamic, which essentially computes the time at which edges and nodes should appear and disappear. head(net$edges) source target created_at end n_edges _ColinFay apreshillhttps 2018-07-30 07:00:21 2018-07-30 07:00:21 1 _ColinFay djnavarro 2018-07-23 10:00:24 2018-07-23 10:00:24 1 _ColinFay dmi3k 2018-07-22 07:55:03 2018-07-22 07:55:03 2 _ColinFay EvaMaeRey 2018-07-28 07:09:27 2018-07-28 07:09:27 1 _ColinFay F9BqxHSrBg 2018-07-30 07:00:21 2018-07-30 07:00:21 1 _ColinFay FurrierTranform 2018-07-29 07:22:57 2018-07-29 07:22:57 1 9.4 Visualise Now for the visualisation, let’s build it step by step; first we prep the data as we did before: renaming a few columns but also running a few unfamiliar computations. To explain we need to tackle how edges will dinamically appear on the graph. The way this works in sigmajs is by specifying the delay in milliseconds before each respective edge should be added. Therefore, we need to transform the date to milliseconds and rescale them to be within a reasonable range: we don’t want the edges to actually take 15 days to appear on the graph. We change the date (POSIXct actually) to a numeric which gives the number of milliseconds since 1970. We rescale between 0 and 1 then multiply by 10,000 (milliseconds) so that the edges are added over 10 seconds. library(dplyr) c(edges, nodes) %&lt;-% net # unpack nodes &lt;- nodes2sg(nodes) edges &lt;- edges %&gt;% mutate( id = 1:n(), created_at = as.numeric(created_at), created_at = (created_at - min(created_at)) / (max(created_at) - min(created_at)), created_at = created_at * 10000 ) %&gt;% select(id, source, target, created_at) Now, the actual visualisation, as mentioned at the begining to the chapter, we’ll plot the nodes then add edges dynamically. Let’s break it down step by step. First, we plot the nodes. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size, label) We’ll add the layout as it looks a bit messy with nodes randomly scattered across the canvas. We’ll have to compute the layout differently this time, we cannot simply use sg_layout as it requires both nodes and edges and we only have nodes on the graph; instead we use sg_get_layout. This is something that we had not shared with you earlier on, sg_nodes must have x and y coordinates of each node, however, if missing they are generated randomly by the package. sg_get_layout computes the coordinates of the nodes (x and y) andd adds them to our nodes data.frame. nodes &lt;- sg_get_layout(nodes, edges) head(nodes) id label start end type size x y _ColinFay _ColinFay 2018-07-20 18:15:13 2018-07-30 14:32:01 user 21 -89.99078 64.47536 _hughesan _hughesan 2018-07-29 23:01:51 2018-07-29 23:01:51 user 1 -177.49397 265.10468 _J_sinclair _J_sinclair 2018-07-26 10:37:29 2018-07-27 13:16:36 user 12 96.51553 166.76335 _jameslamb _jameslamb 2018-07-24 04:52:14 2018-07-24 04:52:14 user 3 47.11911 -104.28996 _RCharlie _RCharlie 2018-07-30 14:09:41 2018-07-30 14:09:41 user 2 242.55138 126.38665 0dkKaQkWNK 0dkKaQkWNK 2018-07-28 09:03:11 2018-07-28 09:03:11 user 1 142.91899 106.82687 Now we can simply pass the coordinates x and y to sg_nodes. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size, label, x, y) Let’s beautify the graph a little, this deep black is somewhat unnerving. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size, label, x, y) %&gt;% sg_settings( defaultNodeColor = &quot;#127ba3&quot;, edgeColor = &quot;default&quot;, defaultEdgeColor = &quot;#d3d3d3&quot;, minNodeSize = 1, maxNodeSize = 4, minEdgeSize = 0.3, maxEdgeSize = 0.3 ) Now we have something that looks like a graph, except it’s missing edges. Let’s add them. We add the edges almost exactly as we did before, we use sg_add_edges instead of sg_edges. Other than the function name, the only difference is that we pass created_at as delay. We also set cumsum to FALSE or the function computes the cumulative sum on the delay, which is, here, our created_at column. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size, label, x, y) %&gt;% sg_add_edges(edges, created_at, id, source, target, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_settings( defaultNodeColor = &quot;#127ba3&quot;, edgeColor = &quot;default&quot;, defaultEdgeColor = &quot;#d3d3d3&quot;, minNodeSize = 1, maxNodeSize = 4, minEdgeSize = 0.3, maxEdgeSize = 0.3 ) Now the edges appear dynamically. However you probably missed that as the animation is triggered when the page is loaded. sigmajs provides an easy workaround: we can add a button for the user to trigger the animation themself. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size, label, x, y) %&gt;% sg_add_edges(edges, created_at, id, source, target, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_button(&quot;Add edges&quot;, &quot;add_edges&quot;) %&gt;% sg_settings( defaultNodeColor = &quot;#127ba3&quot;, edgeColor = &quot;default&quot;, defaultEdgeColor = &quot;#d3d3d3&quot;, minNodeSize = 1, maxNodeSize = 4, minEdgeSize = 0.3, maxEdgeSize = 0.3 ) "],
["temporal.html", "Chapter 10 Temporal graph 10.1 Collect 10.2 Build 10.3 Visualise", " Chapter 10 Temporal graph In the previous chapter we built a graph with dynamic edges. Let’s build a fully dynamic graph where both nodes and edges appear when they are first created. We will then, based on the latter graph have nodes and edges disapear. Why? Tweets are not eternal and probably have a certain lifespan. 10.1 Collect We again collect tweets in a slightly different manner but feel free to use data from a previous chapter. We specify type as mixed in order to get a mix of popular and recent tweets. # TK &lt;- readRDS(file = &quot;token.rds&quot;) tweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;#rstats filter:mentions&quot;, n = 1000, token = TK, include_rts = FALSE, type = &quot;mixed&quot;) ## Searching for tweets... ## Finished collecting tweets! 10.2 Build We build the graph as we did in the previous chapter. net &lt;- tweets %&gt;% gt_edges(text, screen_name, status_id, created_at = &quot;created_at&quot;) %&gt;% gt_nodes() %&gt;% gt_dyn() %&gt;% gt_collect() 10.3 Visualise Again, we unpack the network and prepare nodes and edges for our visualisation. Then we define a rescale functiion to ensure our treatment of the date time columns are consistent across nodes and edges. library(dplyr) c(edges, nodes) %&lt;-% net #&#39; @param x Date time column. #&#39; @param t Number of milliseconds to rescale to. rescale &lt;- function(x, t){ x &lt;- as.numeric(x) x &lt;- (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)) x &lt;- x * t return(x) } Next we prepare the data, we define the t argument of our rescale function defined above as a constant so as to make sure we apply the same scale to both nodes and edges. T &lt;- 10000 lockBinding(&quot;T&quot;, globalenv()) nodes &lt;- nodes %&gt;% mutate( id = nodes, label = nodes, size = n_edges, start = rescale(start, T) ) %&gt;% select(id, label, size, start) edges &lt;- edges %&gt;% mutate( id = 1:n(), created_at = as.numeric(created_at), created_at = rescale(created_at, T) ) %&gt;% select(id, source, target, created_at) As the graph is we might run into issues. sigmajs can only connect edges to nodes that exist, nodes that are already on the graph, currently the edge will appear at the same time as the node and it might cause clashes. We can simply remedy to that by having the edges appear a fraction of a second after the node. # add half a second edges$created_at &lt;- edges$created_at + 500 Now the actual visualisation, then again, we set cumsum = FALSE, and add a button (linked to add_nodes_edges) to let you trigger the visualisation. before then you should see a blank canvas. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_add_nodes(nodes, start, id, label, size, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_add_edges(edges, created_at, id, source, target, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_button(&quot;Start&quot;, &quot;add_nodes_edges&quot;) We forgot the layout and we do not color the nodes, let’s compute the layout and the clusters to color nodes. nodes &lt;- sg_get_layout(nodes, edges) nodes &lt;- sg_get_cluster( nodes, edges, colors = c( &quot;#0084b4&quot;, &quot;#00aced&quot;, &quot;#1dcaff&quot;, &quot;#c0deed&quot; ) ) ## Found # 278 clusters sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_add_nodes(nodes, start, id, label, size, color, x, y, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_add_edges(edges, created_at, id, source, target, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_button(&quot;Start&quot;, &quot;add_nodes_edges&quot;) So we transformed our date time to milliseconds and rescaled to span 10 seconds. The problem with this is that we, in a way, lose track of time in the visualisation itself. It’d be great to add a ticker to display, say, the date. Let’s explain how this is done in sigmajs; we simply create a table that maps dates to our milliseconds delay. To do so we extract the dates from our net object, we then rescale those dates just like we did for the nodes and edges. dates &lt;- as.Date(net$nodes$start) ticker &lt;- dplyr::tibble( dates = dates, delay = rescale(dates, T) ) %&gt;% arrange(delay) head(ticker) dates delay 2018-07-20 0.0000 2018-07-21 228.0671 2018-07-22 1238.9608 2018-07-23 2276.2068 2018-07-24 3279.2967 2018-07-25 4297.0450 Now, how do we use this mapping table in sigmajs? sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_add_nodes(nodes, start, id, label, size, color, x, y, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_add_edges(edges, created_at, id, source, target, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_progress(ticker, delay, dates, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_button(&quot;Start&quot;, &quot;add_nodes_edges&quot;) We use the sg_progress function to which we pass both the ticker columns’ variables.

["ephemeral.html", "Chapter 11 Ephemeral 11.1 Collect 11.2 Build 11.3 Visualise", " Chapter 11 Ephemeral At this stage we’ve pretty much fully covered temporal graphs; nodes and edges appear over time on the graph. This already comes closer to reflecting reality if we assume that tweets are everlasting. In practice tweets have a life span; it is unlikely that old tweets from 2015 will be seen today. Therefore, on our graph, nodes and edges should appear then disappear after some time. 11.1 Collect Let’s collect some tweets, just as we did previously. # TK &lt;- readRDS(file = &quot;token.rds&quot;) tweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;#rstats filter:mentions&quot;, n = 200, token = TK, include_rts = FALSE) ## Searching for tweets... ## Finished collecting tweets! 11.2 Build Just as we did in the temporal chapter, we’ll pass created_at so that we know when tweets are created (when edges and nodes should appear), with one difference: we specify lifetime in our gt_dyn function. net &lt;- tweets %&gt;% gt_edges(text, screen_name, status_id, created_at = &quot;created_at&quot;) %&gt;% gt_nodes() %&gt;% gt_dyn(60 * 60 * 6) %&gt;% gt_collect() The lifetime argument takes milliseconds, above, we set it 60 * 60 * 6 which is equal to 6 hours. As you might expect, we will rescale the timeframe as we did before but here we set the lifetime of a tweet before doing so.

Let’s plot the distribution of the lifespans of nodes (in milliseconds): the difference between their appearance and disappearance. nodes$difference &lt;- as.numeric(nodes$end - nodes$start) hist( main = &quot;Distribution of nodes lifespan&quot;, nodes$difference ) We see that, unlike edges nodes are not all present on the graph for the same amount of time (6 hours for edges). There is a simple reason for it. If a user has tweeted at two (or more) different times in our dataset it will be present the from its first tweet to its second tweet (+ 6 hours). 11.3 Visualise To tackle the visualisation let’s bring back our rescaling function. As a reminder this is so that the nodes do not take 2.5385764 to come and go but rather 60 seconds (60,000 milliseconds) as specified by the t argument. #&#39; @param x Date time column. #&#39; @param t Number of milliseconds to rescale to. rescale &lt;- function(x, t){ x &lt;- as.numeric(x) x &lt;- (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)) x &lt;- x * t return(x) } Then onto preparing the data. We do something similar as we did previously expect we also rescale end. There was no need to do that before as there was no need to do that since nodes and edges were only appearing on the graph and not disappearing. We add 500 milliseconds (half a second) to the edge created time to ensure that it is created after the node as we need the edges to be created based on nodes already drawn on the graph: an additional 200 milliseconds ensures the nodes each respective edge connects are present on the graph. library(dplyr) SCALE &lt;- 60000 # 30 seconds nodes &lt;- nodes2sg(nodes) nodes &lt;- nodes %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% mutate( start = rescale(start, SCALE), end = rescale(end, SCALE) ) %&gt;% select(id, label, size, start, end) edges &lt;- edges %&gt;% mutate( id = 1:n(), created_at = rescale(created_at, SCALE) + 200, end = rescale(end, SCALE) + (60 * 60 * 6) ) %&gt;% select(id, source, target, start = created_at, end) Finally onto the visualisation, we again use sg_drop_nodes and sg_drop_edges, but this time, as we want them to also disappear we also use sg_drop_nodes and sg_drop_edges. With regard to the latter functions, since we only need to remove them from the graph we just need to specify their respective ids. Then again, we can specify the x and y coordinates as well as the color of the nodes whcih we’ll base on clusters in order to make the graph look better. nodes &lt;- sg_get_layout(nodes, edges) nodes &lt;- sg_get_cluster( nodes, edges, colors = c( &quot;#0084b4&quot;, &quot;#00aced&quot;, &quot;#1dcaff&quot;, &quot;#c0deed&quot; ) ) ## Found # 73 clusters sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_add_nodes(nodes, start, id, label, size, color, x, y, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_add_edges(edges, start, id, source, target, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_drop_nodes(nodes, id, end, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_drop_edges(edges, id, end, cumsum = FALSE) The animation is triggered on page launch, reload the page if you missed it. There is quite a bit going on, like in the previous chapter we’re having difficulties keeping track of time. Let’s add the time ticker, we’ll prepare the data.frame exactly as we did before. datetime &lt;- net$nodes$start ticker &lt;- dplyr::tibble( dates = as.POSIXct(round(datetime, &quot;hours&quot;)), # round to nearest hour delay = rescale(datetime, SCALE) ) %&gt;% group_by(dates) %&gt;% summarise(delay = min(delay)) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% arrange(delay) knitr::kable(head(ticker)) dates delay 2018-07-28 03:00:00 0.0000 2018-07-28 04:00:00 986.1717 2018-07-28 07:00:00 4301.6783 2018-07-28 08:00:00 4784.7793 2018-07-28 09:00:00 6168.4288 2018-07-28 10:00:00 6996.2112 Then we plot the graph just adding sg_progress. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_add_nodes(nodes, start, id, label, size, color, x, y, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_add_edges(edges, start, id, source, target, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_drop_nodes(nodes, id, end, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_drop_edges(edges, id, end, cumsum = FALSE) %&gt;% sg_progress(ticker, delay, dates, cumsum = FALSE) "],
["rmd.html", "Chapter 12 R markdown 12.1 Buttons 12.2 Delays", " Chapter 12 R markdown This chapter covers R markdown-specific functions of the twinetverse. We’ve actually covered a few of those already, rtweet and graphTweets do not have functions specifically meant to be used in R markdown, all work just as well in a interactive and non-interactive environments. The dynamic nature of sigmajs, however, suggests the intriduction of additional functions. # TK &lt;- readRDS(file = &quot;token.rds&quot;) tweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;#rstats filter:mentions&quot;, n = 1000, token = TK, include_rts = FALSE) ## Searching for tweets... ## Finished collecting tweets! 12.1 Buttons One of the functions of the sigmajs package that we have already covered enables adding buttons to make trigger events in sigmajs: sg_button. These events need to be tied to the visualisation, the button (sg_button) is only the trigger. Most events can be used without triggers, events that cannot just be used on their own are exports: export_svg and export_img. The events are simply the name of the function (event) they trigger without the starting sg_, i.e.: export_svg event triggers sg_export_svg. Let’s illustrate the above example. We first draw a graph. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size, color) %&gt;% sg_edges(edges, id, source, target) Then add the event and the corresponding button. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size, color) %&gt;% sg_edges(edges, id, source, target) %&gt;% sg_force_start() %&gt;% sg_button(&quot;start&quot;, &quot;force_start&quot;) Below are the events that can be tied to buttons. force_start force_stop noverlap drag_nodes relative_size add_nodes add_edges add_nodes_edges drop_nodes drop_edges animate export_svg export_img 12.2 Delays some functions of the sigmajs package take a delay argument, which, though can be used in any way or framework (shiny, R markdown, etc.), it is specifically designed with R markdown in mind. Take for instance the layout algorithm and button we used above; as you read this it is still running, which is draining for the browser and useless as the layout has stabilised. We could do the inverse of what we do above, of course, trigger the layout on page load and instead provide a button for the user to stop the layout. However, what would be ideal is for the layout to simply stop after a few seconds. Let’s implement the latter. sigmajs() %&gt;% sg_nodes(nodes, id, size, color, x, y) %&gt;% sg_edges(edges, id, source, target) %&gt;% sg_force_start() %&gt;% sg_force_stop(10000) We removed the button as we just trigger the layout algorithm when the page loads then we pass sg_force_stop specifying that we want the force layout to stop after 10,000 milliseconds (10 seconds).

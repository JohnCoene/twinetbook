# Graphs {#graphs}

Before we get on with the graphs let's go through the types of graphs that the _twinetverse_, through graphTweets, allows you to build. 

## Anatomy

To explain the graphs let's first look at the anatomy of a basic tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> {twinetverse} package; everything you need to collect, build, and visualise <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/twitter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#twitter</a> interactions. In depth documentation thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/xieyihui?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">\@xieyihui</a> {bookdown}: <a href="https://t.co/Sf5WdI8m6p">https://t.co/Sf5WdI8m6p</a> <a href="https://t.co/GxDSeWpqJL">pic.twitter.com/GxDSeWpqJL</a></p>&mdash; John Coene (\@jdatap) <a href="https://twitter.com/jdatap/status/1022573515445297153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The above tweet is posted by someone (\@jdatap), the tweet uses a hashtag (#rstats and #twitter) and \@tags another user (\@xieyihui, the creator of bookdown [@R-bookdown] which is used to write this very book). #hashtags and @users are the core components of tweets that the _twinetverse_ looks into.

## Types

The first type of graph consists of linking the users posting a tweet to its content; the #hashtags he or she uses, or the \@users he tags in his or her tweets. However, we were told by people who worked with networks at Twitter that the more traditional form of Twitter networks are based on _retweets_ as this essentially allows studying and visualising how information spreads throughout the network.

We can also built networks of co-mentions which essentially map co-occurences of either 1) users @tagged in tweets or 2) #hashtags used in tweets.

## Recap

All the types above are listed below.

1. User to @tagged user
2. User to #hashtag
3. User to user retweeted
4. Co-mentioned hashtags
5. Co-mentions user

We will explore all of the above throughout the book.

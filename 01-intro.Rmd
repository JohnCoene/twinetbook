# Introduction {#intro}

The _twinetverse_ includes three packages:

* [_rtweet_](@R-rtweet)
* [_graphTweets_](@R-graphTweets)
* [_sigmajs_](@R-sigmajs)

Within the context of visualising Twitter interactions, each of the packages listed above fill in a specific need and a distinct step of the process, 1) _collecting_ the data, 2) _building_ the graphs and finally 3) _visualising_ the graphs.

We eventually look at the [packages](pkgs) that make up the _twinetverse_.

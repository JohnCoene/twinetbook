# Twinetbook

The [twinetverse](https://twinetverse.john-coene.com) book.

The book is hosted [here](https://twinetbook.john-coene.com/)

## Reproducability

You will need a `twitter_token.rds` file in the root directory in order to re-run the book (as explained in the [Prerequisites chapter](https://twinetbook.john-coene.com/prerequisites.html)). Though the book could be built from just a few saved data files I believe it is important for it to remain *true to real world data* and thus pull and use data just as the reader ultimately will.

# Prerequisites

The goal of the _twinetverse_ is to provide everything one might need efficiently and elegantly visualise Twitter interactions.

The _twinetverse_ package can be installed from Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("JohnCoene/twinetverse")
```

The package is unlikely to make it onto CRAN, it may be considered once all of its children packages are on CRAN, but not until then.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'twinetverse', 'rtweet', 'graphTweets', 'sigmajs',
  'igraph'
), 'packages.bib')
```
